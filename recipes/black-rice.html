    <h1>Black Rice</h1>

    <h2>Carribean Black Rice</h2>
    <p>Black rice is one of the handful of superfoods. This rice is so flavorful and has a very unique presentation as
        it cooks
        up to a deep purple color. This rice goes great with just about any meal as a nice healthy side. I love to make
        it with
        salmon and a side of fresh veggies.</p>
