    <h2>Fried Jerk Chicken Wings</h2>
    <p>These jerk chicken wings were so flavorful, so different, and so additively delicious, that I may have eaten my
        last Buffalo wing.
        Okay, I didn't mean that, but these really are amazing; a perfect balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy. </p>
    <p>I'm usually pretty casual about you changing my recipes, but I'm going to have to insist you not change any of
        the key ingredients, which are, every one of them.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Yellow Onion Chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Green Onions Sliced </li>
        <li>6 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>3 Habanero Peppers </li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Lime Jucie</li>
        <li>3 Pounds Chicken Wing Drummets </li>
        <li>Cooking Spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Put yellow onion, green onions, garlic, habanero peppers, fresh thyme, kosher salt, black pepper, allspice,
            dried thyme,
            cinnamon, cumin, nutmeg, vegetable oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, and lime juice, respectively, in a blender
            and blend
            until marinade is completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a large bowl. Pour marinade over chicken and toss to coat completely. Cover the bowl with
            plastic wrap
            and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking
            spray.</li>
    </ol>
